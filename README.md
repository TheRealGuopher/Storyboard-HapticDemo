# Storyboard-HapticDemo

This demo shows how you can refactor your storyboard and use storyboard references to separate your UIViewControllers into separate storyboards. Not only does this reduce clutter and lag when you use storyboards, this is the best way to prevent merge conflicts during group projects.

In addition, tap on "Haptic" on the UITabBar to see the haptic demo and how you can potentially use this in your final project. Note this only works on iPhone 7 or higher.

I would write directions on how to refactor your storyboard/use storyboard references here but there's too many steps and there's a decent amount of visual components. Feel free to Slack me for any questions. If not, here's a great tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htQATVxlLng.
